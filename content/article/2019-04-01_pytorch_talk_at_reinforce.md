I gave a talk "Practical PyTorch 101"
at [Reinforce Conf](https://reinforceconf.com/) in Budapest last March.
~~Here is the [presentation](https://nodata.science/practical_pytorch_talk_reinforce_2019/) and the 
[youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pRBzh_hGqA).~~
Update 2024: The video is not available anymore, but you can find and older video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H3aw6wkCv0).

I also gave a PyTorch workshop and
[updated my material](https://github.com/sotte/pytorch_tutorial). Enjoy!

Thanks to the folks organizing the conference, it was a lot of fun.
