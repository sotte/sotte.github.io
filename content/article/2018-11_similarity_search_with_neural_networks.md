I gave a talk "Fun with Content-based Image Retrieval with Neural Network" at
the
[PyData Berlin Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/PyData-Berlin/events/255903846/).
Here are the [slides as pdf](images/CBIR-talk.pdf).

Thanks again to the PyData Berlin folks for organizing the event and thanks to
all the people who attended the event.
I really enjoyed the interesting conversations with you, thanks!
